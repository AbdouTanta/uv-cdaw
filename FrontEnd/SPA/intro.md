# Single Page Application
In this section, we will learn the concept of Single Page Application, how to make a SPA and how to dedicated client side framework.

| Classic Web App | Single Page App |
| :------------- | :----------: |
| Made of several pages | Only one page |
| Web browsers generally just display pages and gives to the server the users' input | Web browsers fully exploited and dynamically retrieve content from the server |
| All the logic of the App is served-sided | Either the logic is client sided (beurk!) or separate as much as possible to not compromise security |
| Server reacts to user interaction and serves new page | The server is responsible to expose and make accessible app's resources (*e.g.* REST API)| 

Rely heavily on the notion of web components (cf. dedicated [section](component.md))
## Vue.js
