### Data types
JavaScript is weakly typed, meaning that the variables do not have a specific on their declaration. Instead, we use a generic keyword declaration to declare a new variable.

There is only **three** declaration keywords in JS. They are:

* `let`: allows the declaration of a block scope **local variable** (it is destroyed while outside the block) ; it can optionally be initialized to a value ;
* `var`: declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value ;
* `const`: declares a read-only named constant.

```js
var myVar = 7;
```
