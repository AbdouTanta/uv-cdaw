# Object-oriented Programming



* Anything that is not a primitive type (`undefined`, `null`, `number`, `string`, `boolean`) is an object (or an instance) in JavaScript. That means function inherits from object.
* Object instances can contain more instances which can be functions. That's what we call a `method` (since it has an automatic `this` variable).
* Since you can't "call" every Object instance, not every object is a function.
